Machine Learning: Regression - Predicting Energy Efficiency of Buildings
Difficulty levels: College, Graduate School, Professional
Regression, a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines, attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable and a series of other variables (known as independent variables). 

In this course, we will develop a multivariate multiple regression model to study the effect of eight input variables on two output variables, which are the heating load and the cooling load, of residential buildings.

Lesson 3
Penalization Methods
Duration: Individually Paced
About The Lesson
In this lesson, you will learn about regularization as a method to make complex models simpler by penalising coefficients to reduce their magnitude, variance in the training set and in turn, reduce overfitting in the model.

All codes used in this lesson can be found here.

Becoming a Data Storyteller
Dataset Description
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00374/

The dataset  is the Appliances Energy Prediction data. The data set is at 10 min for about 4.5 months. The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Each wireless node transmitted the temperature and humidity conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wireless data was averaged for 10 minutes periods. The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy meters. Weather from the nearest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru), and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column. Two random variables have been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to filter out non predictive attributes (parameters). The attribute information can be seen below.
